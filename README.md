👋 Hi, I’m @avi2512, also known as Raghav.
👀 I’m interested in both Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) and Web Development.
🌱 Currently, I’m diving deep into DSA while also working on building web projects. I have a particular focus on developing solutions using Flask and integrating features like GIS, route optimization, and public transport systems.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Web Development projects, especially those that involve Flask backends, GIS integrations, and system optimization.
📫 Reach out to me via email at leaguegame990@gmail.com.
⚡ Fun fact: I’ve been preparing for my SSB interview, and I enjoy practicing problem-solving for various scenarios!
